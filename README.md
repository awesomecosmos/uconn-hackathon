## Investigating AI Safety in Face Recognition Systems 

The overview of this project is to identify vulnerabilities in computer vision systems, applied in the context of a face recognition application.

**Problem:** Once trained, computer vision models may have vulnerabilties which can be exploited by adversaries. We can make our AI systems stronger, and *safer*, by first identifying possible vulnerabilities, and then addressing these vulnerabilites. 

**Context:** We will investigate vulnerabilities in a face recognition model.

**Dataset:** [Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset)

**Model:** A pre-trained ResNet-18.
